Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
This repository showcases my implementation of a data warehousing and analytics solution, demonstrating skills in data engineering, ETL development, and analytical reporting. The project follows industry best practices for building a scalable data pipeline.

🏗️ Data Architecture
The solution implements a Medallion Architecture with three layers:

Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion from CSV sources into SQL Server

Silver Layer: Data cleansing, standardization, and quality checks

Gold Layer: Business-ready star schema models optimized for analytics

📖 Project Highlights
This implementation demonstrates:

✅ End-to-end data pipeline from source systems to analytical insights
✅ SQL-based ETL processes with documented transformation logic
✅ Dimensional modeling following the star schema best practices
✅ Actionable reporting on key business metrics

This project involves:
1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
