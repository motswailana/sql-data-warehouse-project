SILVER LAYER DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    This validation script systematically evaluates data quality metrics across
    the silver layer transformation outputs. The assessment framework verifies:
    
    - Key Integrity: Primary key uniqueness and non-null constraints
    - Data Cleanness: Removal of extraneous whitespace and formatting issues
    - Domain Compliance: Adherence to standardized values and enumerations
    - Temporal Validity: Chronological consistency of date fields
    - Business Logic: Mathematical and relational consistency between fields

Operational Context:
    - Execution Phase: Post-load verification for silver layer transformations
    - Severity Model:
      • Critical: Data integrity violations (PK issues, invalid dates)
      • Warning: Formatting issues that may affect usability
      • Informational: Reference data distributions
    
Response Protocol:
    1. Critical items must be resolved before progressing to gold layer
    2. Warning items should be addressed based on business impact
    3. Informational results provide monitoring baseline for data trends

Maintenance:
    Version: 1.1
